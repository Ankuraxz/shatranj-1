## Background
During the lockdown in light of the pandemic, we all witnessed a sharp increase in the popularity of chess.
As most sporting action shut down because of the lockdown, chess found new life online with several tournaments taking place. In an interview to PTI, the 51-year-old maestro Viswanathan Anand touched upon a variety of subjects, including the immense popularity of chess-based Netflix drama 'The Queen's Gambit, his new role of a mentor to youngsters and an upcoming biopic on his remarkable career and life.

'The Queen's Gambit', a drama on the life of an orphaned chess prodigy who rises to the top while struggling with drugs and alcohol, has made chess appealing to a younger generation with online searches for the sport and its practitioners hitting a new high.

Reputed chess website chess.com declared that it's subscriber base shot up significantly after the series's release. With Samay Raina, a renowned Comedian and an avid Chess Enthusiast onboard BUIDL IT, we decided to try our hands over the ancient game of Shatranj with Asharfi - $ASHF, a new cryptotoken , which just like Chess, boomed in Indian households this year.
